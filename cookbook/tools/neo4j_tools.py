"""
Example script demonstrating the use of Neo4jTools with an Agno agent.
This script sets up an agent that can interact with a Neo4j database using natural language queries,
such as listing node labels or executing Cypher queries.

## Setting up Neo4j Locally

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Install Docker** if you haven't already from https://www.docker.com/

2. **Run Neo4j in Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker run \
       --name neo4j \
       -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
       -d \
       -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
       -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
       -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \
       -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \
       --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
       neo4j:latest
   ```

3. **Access Neo4j Browser:** Open http://localhost:7474 in your browser
   - Username: `neo4j`
   - Password: `password`

### Option 2: Native Installation

1. **Download Neo4j Desktop** from https://neo4j.com/download/
2. **Install and create a new database**
3. **Start the database** and note the connection details

### Option 3: Using Neo4j Community Edition

1. **Download** from https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community
2. **Extract and run:**
   ```bash
   tar -xf neo4j-community-*-unix.tar.gz
   cd neo4j-community-*
   ./bin/neo4j start
   ```

## Python Setup

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install neo4j python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** (create a `.env` file in your project root):
   ```env
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
   ```

## Usage

1. **Ensure Neo4j is running** (check http://localhost:7474)
2. **Run this script** to create an agent that can interact with your Neo4j database
3. **Test with queries** like "What are the node labels in my graph?" or "Show me the database schema"

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused:** Make sure Neo4j is running on the correct port (7687)
- **Authentication failed:** Verify your username/password in the Neo4j browser first
- **Import errors:** Install the neo4j driver with `pip install neo4j`
