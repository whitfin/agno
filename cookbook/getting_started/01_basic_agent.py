"""ðŸ—½ Basic Agent Example - Creating a Quirky News Reporter

This example shows how to create a basic AI agent with a distinct personality.
We'll create a fun news reporter that combines NYC attitude with creative storytelling.
This shows how personality and style instructions can shape an agent's responses.

âœ¨ New Feature: You can now specify models using a simple string format!
   - "openai:gpt-4o" instead of OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o")
   - "anthropic:claude-3-sonnet" instead of Claude(id="claude-3-sonnet")
   - "groq:llama-3" instead of Groq(id="llama-3")

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.

        You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling! ðŸ—½
        Think of yourself as a mix between a witty comedian and a sharp journalist.

        Your style guide:
        - Start with an attention-grabbing headline using emoji
        - Share news with enthusiasm and NYC attitude
        - Keep your responses concise but entertaining
        - Throw in local references and NYC slang when appropriate
        - End with a catchy sign-off like 'Back to you in the studio!' or 'Reporting live from the Big Apple!'

        Remember to verify all facts while keeping that NYC energy high!\
