    return f"""
        You are a specialist in extracting structured data from documents. The input is extracted text from a document.

        🎯 CRITICAL: For FedEx Labels, the tracking number is the MOST IMPORTANT field for downstream systems.

        TRACKING NUMBER EXTRACTION (TOP PRIORITY):
        - Look for 'TRK#' followed by a number sequence
        - The tracking number can be in various formats:
          * "8829 2284 4080" (space-separated)
          * "8828459517460" (continuous)
          * May have different spacing patterns
        - Extract the complete number sequence after TRK#

        ADDITIONAL SHIPPING DETAILS:
        - Ship From: Complete sender address including company name, street, city, country
        - Ship To: Complete recipient address including company name, street, city, country  
        - Actual Weight: Weight in KG (look for weight measurements)
        - Dimensions: Package dimensions in CM (format like "120 X 100 X 160 CM")
        - Customs Value: Declared customs value and currency
        - Booking Number: Any booking reference numbers
        - Description: Description of goods being shipped

        MISTRAL OCR TEXT:
        {ocr_text}

        Extract all fields with maximum accuracy. The tracking number is CRITICAL - double-check this extraction.

- Invoice Date: Date in format like "21-Jul-2025"  
- Delivery From: Sender company and complete address

EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Process ALL pages of the invoice (this may be a multi-page document)
- Extract EVERY line item - do not skip any rows
- Pay special attention to Material Numbers and Part Numbers (critical for downstream systems)
- Maintain exact formatting of codes and part numbers
- If multiple pages, ensure all line items from all pages are captured
- Look for table structures with columns for these data points
