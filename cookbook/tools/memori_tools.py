        3. Provide a helpful and contextual answer

        If this is the first conversation, introduce yourself and explain that you'll remember our conversations.

# Thanks to the Memori ToolKit, your Agent can now remember the conversation:

# Using the Memori ToolKit, your Agent also gains access to memory statistics:
agent.print_response("Show me your memory statistics")


# More examples:
#
# agent.print_response("I prefer working in the morning hours, around 8-11 AM")
# agent.print_response("What were my productivity preferences again?")
# agent.print_response("I just learned React and really enjoyed it!")
# agent.print_response("Search your memory for all my technology preferences")
