"""
1. Run: `pip install openai ddgs newspaper4k lxml_html_clean agno` to install the dependencies
2. Run: `python cookbook/teams/coordinate/hackernews_team.py` to run the agent

This example demonstrates a coordinated team of AI agents working together to research topics across different platforms.

The team consists of three specialized agents:
1. HackerNews Researcher - Uses HackerNews API to find and analyze relevant HackerNews posts
2. Web Searcher - Uses DuckDuckGo to find and analyze relevant web pages
3. Article Reader - Reads articles from URLs

The team leader coordinates the agents by:
- Giving each agent a specific task
- Providing clear instructions for each agent
- Collecting and summarizing the results from each agent
